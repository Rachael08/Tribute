                   <b>In memory of steve jobs :( </b> <br> 
                    Truly terrible news about Steve Jobs passing away. I realize that I never knew him but the truth is that his products, he and his team created, have given me all the amazing opportunities in my life. They allowed me to express myself and my creativity along with millions of others. You will be missed Mr. Jobs!

                    <b>Thanks Steve.</b> <br>
                    Thank you Steve Jobs. Thank you for making my world better. Thank you for changing the world of computing. Thank you for making the first computer I ever used and many since then. And, finally thank you for so many great memories. You will be greatly missed. My deepest condolences go out to the Jobs family and all of Apple. My thoughts and prayers are with you all. <br>

                    How does the world replace someone like you? It doesn't. All we can do is cherish all that you have left us, which will extend well beyond the next product life cycle. The technology you pioneered and envisioned cut through the complexity and became embraceable, usable, and ultimately life-changing, for better or worse . I say 'worse' because I love some of your products so much that I sometimes get lost in them. You were simply that good. Thanks again for leaving an indelible imprint on my life and our world. You will not soon be forgotten, Steve. Your genius will live on and influence many generations to come. I for one am glad I got to 'know' you through your ingenious products that will forever change the way the world communicates and educates. My deepest condolences to the Jobs family. <br>
